## MetaPyTools For Crafing Custom Meta-Data By Hand
### Issue:
1. Single Spreadsheet ( Excel )
2. 18 Cols
3. 9999 Line Items
4. Disorder To Data

### Resolutions:
1. Export Into JSON
2. Shape Into CSV

Use as a Fabric Data Shaping Model - I Will generate one with OpenAI - This doesn't change the fact that every data set is unique.

These files are Python3 tools we created to handle custom, by-hand Meta-Data that didn't come from a generative collection

## Disclaimer:
Coded Before AI ;)
